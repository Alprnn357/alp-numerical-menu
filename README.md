# Alp Numerical Menu for CS16Client/Xash3D Android
The Alp's customizable numerical menu
Yes, that's right. This is just a simple numerical menu but not too simple!
# Features
- Client menu style
- 5 different types of numerical menu*
- Custom color support*
- Fade animation*
- Transparent buttons*
- Open source! You're free to view/edit/fork/publish it anytime but please don't avoid giving credit for me.

Note*: The config file needed to configure these which is given in the releases tab.
# Installation
- Download the latest .pak file from Releases section.
- Put the .pak file to your game data folder. (Ex: /sdcard/xash/cstrike)
- Launch the game.
- (Optional) For configure the menu (like changing buttons color, menu type etc.), download "alp_numericalmenu.cfg" file from Releases and put it to your game data folder then open it with text mode and change the values which are given between double quotation marks.
- Note: When adding "alp_numericalmenu.cfg" file, be sure to put two .pak and .cfg files into the same directory.
# Notes
- If you want to use it with Xash3D App, you have to create new button by setting "exec touch/numerical_menu" as command. (menu is executed automatically in CS16Client, so no need to do the same)
# If the menu doesn't work
- Check the other .pak files in the same folder. Some .pak files can overlap if they uses the same named files in the same directories. if there's more, remove them out of it then launch the game again.
- Check the touch folder and .cfg files in it, because this menu uses numerical menu config files. So you should remove them too.
- Try to create a new folder named "custom" in the same folder then move the .pak file into it (This method is recommended)
- Still same? Maybe you should check the path (which configs, game saves, etc. are stored) in the Xash3D App.
